I was never a fan of the Verne\\'s books and Around the World in 80 days is no exception, but i still enjoyed this game a lot. My best playthrough happened when i tried to cheat and just walked around the North Pole, it is great that game actually allows you to do so. It’s a visual novel mixed with role-playing mixed with Rogue-like meaning each trip will be quite different from the next.
